<h2>What Is 1 Point Perspective?</h2>

<p>
1 point perspective is a drawing method where all parallel lines converge toward a single vanishing point on the horizon line. It is commonly used for interior scenes, roads, hallways, railways, and architectural drawings.
</p>

<p>
In 1 point perspective, depth is created by directing all receding lines toward one central vanishing point. This technique is ideal for beginners learning perspective fundamentals.
</p>

<h2>How a 1 Point Perspective Grid Helps</h2>

<p>
A perspective grid simplifies the process of drawing depth correctly. Instead of manually constructing guidelines, artists can use a grid to ensure accurate alignment of structures and objects.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintains consistent depth</li>
<li>Prevents distortion errors</li>
<li>Saves time in architectural drawing</li>
<li>Helps beginners understand vanishing point logic</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Use 1 Point Perspective</h2>

<p>
1 point perspective works best for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rooms and interiors</li>
<li>Roads and pathways</li>
<li>Symmetrical architecture</li>
<li>Centered compositions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Mistakes in 1 Point Perspective</h2>

<p>
Many beginners struggle with inconsistent vanishing lines. Every line that represents depth must align perfectly with the vanishing point.
Using a structured grid eliminates this issue completely.
